# Smartsheet TypeScript SDK (Monorepo)

> [!NOTE]  
> This repository is the continuation of [the original codebase](https://github.com/ECA-Greentech/smartsheet-typescript) for possible future updates and PRs. Due to an unforeseen circumstance, the maintenance and the development of this package has been discontinued at the original codebase by ECA Solar LLC. This repository is a deep fork of the original codebase and maintains the original license and the authorship.

## Development Guide

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
bun install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

[Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/) is recommended for the development of this package.

### 2. Set up environment variables for local development

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Run the example script defined in `./example/index.ts`

```bash
bun dev
```

## Versioning

We are using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for versioning. In addition to that, we have added `dev` tag for the development version, such as `1.0.0-dev.1`.

As a contributor, you can consider using `bun version dev` to bump up the development version when needed. This version will not be released to the public.

When it is ready to be finalized, you can use `bun version <major|minor|patch>` to bump up the version to the next stable version with proper change size.
